<b> Community Land Trusts and Neighborhood Outcomes </b> with [Omer Ali](https://sites.google.com/site/omeraaali/) <i>(Draft coming soon!)</i>

This paper studies the effect of Community Land Trusts (CLTs) on neighborhood composition and affordability. CLTs are non-profit organizations that buy and resell houses at subsidized prices with one unique feature: the trust keeps the land deed and leases it to homeowners who sign a long-term agreement to limit the homeâ€™s resale price, maintaining its affordability indefinitely. CLTs have been rediscovered in recent years as a popular solution to affordable housing, in part because they also create pathways from renting to homeownership. An important question is whether a CLT - aside from making the purchased dwelling permanently affordable - generates spillover effects on surrounding housing prices by improving neighborhood amenities. We create the first national dataset of CLT housing transactions from 2000 to 2016 and combine it with panel data on individual migration histories to estimate the effects of CLT purchases on home prices and displacement in the surrounding neighborhood. We find preliminary evidence that neighborhood housing values do increase within 200 meters of new CLTs purchases, while the probability of a household moving decreases, implying that CLTs help to revitalize declining neighborhoods. In ongoing work, we are studying the contexts under which this effect is most prevalent, to understand when and where the CLT model is likely to be most effective.
